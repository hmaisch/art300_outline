        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            According to The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), the time of day a test is taken does, in fact, have an effect on the scores received.  I have experienced the struggle that is taking a test at night, and more often than not I would have trouble focusing and performing to the best of my ability because by that point in the day I am drained of most of my energy and struggle to focus.  If the time of day a test is taken does correlate to increase or decrease in test scores, and research has shown that the later a test is taken, it’s more likely to see a decrease in scores, then why are there still tests being scheduled to take place in the evening?  The problem with taking tests at night is not only because of the higher chance of receiving a low score, but it also lowers students’ success rates at Kansas State University, which does not help any of us.  I propose that we consider scheduling tests to take place in class because it will improve average test scores, students will be more cognitively awake, and the University as a whole will benefit as well.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem Description</h1>
        <p>
            We should not have class test times set for the evenings.  This is not only an issue for students but also for the teachers because the test results are not accurate for several reasons that will be discussed later in this letter.  This problem needs to be solved so that there is no longer an inconvenience of testing in the evenings.  In the past, it hasn’t been changed because staff members think that utilizing class time to review or ask questions is a better use of time.  However, there are more negative effects of taking tests at night than during the day, so it would be more beneficial to everyone if the tests were scheduled for during the class time.
        </p>
        <h1>Solution Description</h1>
        <p>
            One way this problem can be solved is by scheduling the tests to be taken in class.  This will allow teachers to not have to come in in the evening and students will have less conflicts because they will be taking it during a time dedicated to that class.  Removing night-time test-taking will also improve average scores because it has been found that students test better during the day when they are cognitively more awake than they are in the evenings.  In turn, this will also benefit the teachers because better grades from their students shows that they have been teaching the information in an efficient way.  There are no costs associated with this solution because you would simply be giving tests during the time slot dedicated to the class.  There are also no resources necessary because, again, you are just moving the test times.
    An alternative solution that you could consider would be to take a survey at the beginning of the year that will determine how many students feel that they would perform better during the day on a test.  This survey can help to determine whether the test time should be moved to be taken during class, or if the night test time will work for everyone.  This solution would require every student to take part in the survey and could be implemented by their teacher during the first week of class.  This solution will affect both the teachers and students because it could help to prevent decrease in test scores and will allow teachers to have a more accurate representation of the student’s understanding of the material.  There are not costs associated with this solution.  The only resources necessary to pursue this solution are electronic devices so that the students can take the survey, however it can also be done by hand if technology is not accessible to every student or teacher.
        </p>
        <h1>Justification</h1>
        <p>
            Moving all test times to be during class might not sound like the easiest solution, but it is the most effective option. Removing night-time test-taking will improve average scores because it has been found that students test better during the day when they are cognitively more awake than they are in the evenings. According to The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) “Time of day affects students’ test performance because, over the course of a regular day, students’ mental resources get taxed. Thus, as the day wears on, students become increasingly fatigued and consequently more likely to underperform” (par. 1).  A higher number of students who perform well on a given test will result in more positive effects on the teachers because they will have higher statistics of how well their students do in their class.  This will not only be beneficial to the students because of their higher scores, but it will also benefit the university as a whole.  And after all, as director of testing at Kansas State University, I would like to think that you value the success of students on tests.  By moving tests to take place during class, test score averages would improve, teachers would have a more accurate representation of students’ overall understanding of the content, and there would be fewer conflicts with scheduling.
    If test times are moved to take place during class, the increase in average scores will not only benefit students, but the university as well.  This is true because if more students perform well on a given test, the overall rankings of KSU’s testing will increase, and is that not one of your main goals for the university?  Scientists from the Danish National Center for Social Research found from their study that “scores for a test taken at 9am were likely to be 5.4 percent higher than if the same exam was taken at 3pm” (Al-Othman, par. 3).  They also found that for every hour later a test was taken, the students’ scores decreased by almost a percent.  Imagine how much students attending KSU could improve their grades just by scheduling the tests for during the day.  Taking that one step further, there could also be a large increase in the overall success of the University.
    If students test when their brains are more awake, it will give the teachers a more accurate representation of whether or not their students are understanding the concepts they are learning.  If tests are given at night, students are more likely to underperform, therefore leading to teachers receiving a less accurate representation of the students’ understanding of the course content.
    According to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), “assessments can be a vital component in our efforts to improve education” (par. 32).  If exams are as important as schools insist that they are, then don’t you think moving test times to be during the class period would be more beneficial to everyone?  If this solution is implemented, not only would test scores improve, and teachers would have a more accurate representation of their students’ understanding of the content, but the university as a whole would benefit as well because the overall average of students’ scores would increase, leading to an increase in the student success rate in that particular course at KSU.
    Moving all test times to take place during class is also the longest lasting solution because it will prevent any conflicts that may occur if the test times were to stay scheduled for only the evening or night.  For example, most students majoring in a science are enrolled in courses that have test times that are scheduled back to back.  This might not create conflicts with the times of the tests, however, it can cause conflicts with students being able to perform to the best of their ability if they do have two tests right after each other.  As cited earlier from the PNAS, the time of day a test is taken does have an effect on how well the students will perform on it (par. 1).  If students are taking more than one test on the same day, they are more likely to underperform due to cognitive fatigue and additional stress.  This underperformance will only prevent teachers from receiving valuable feedback because it will not be an accurate representation of their students’ understanding of the course content.
    At KSU, students enroll themselves in classes at times that fit their schedule best, meaning they are capable of deciding whether they are going to take classes in the morning or evening.  With that being said, students are enrolling in classes at times that they know they will perform better.  In an article written by students studying Psychology at the University of Toronto, it was predicted that “…adolescents tested at times that are in synchrony with their preferred time of day would perform significantly better on fluid intelligence measures than adolescents tested at their non preferred time of day” (Goldstein, Hahn, Hasher, Wiprzycka, Zelazo, par. 5).  Students are aware of when they perform the best cognitively, so why are tests only scheduled for evenings, when there are some students who do not perform as well at that time of day?  Your current system of scheduling does not seem to take into consideration the fact that not all students are as cognitively prepared as others at night, “…in fact, research has shown individuals’ cognitive functioning (e.g., memory and attention) is at its peak at their optimal time of day and decreases substantially at their nonoptimal times” and this can be more easily avoided by rescheduling tests to be taken during the class time that the students signed up for themselves (Sievertsen, par. 23).
        </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Scheduling tests to take place during class is the best solution to ensure that students are able to perform to the best of their ability and therefore receive better test scores.  Although teachers and students would lose a day of extra review, the university as a whole will benefit from this change because there will be more opportunity for students to perform better if they are testing during the time of day that they signed up for.  By rescheduling test times, there will be more improved test scores which not only benefits the students, but the university as a whole.  If this change is not made, we are just letting students have more opportunity to perform poorly on exams, which does not benefit anyone, including you.
